# Boston-Housing-Price-Prediction
In this project, we build Linear Regression models using StatsModel and scikit-learn to predict the price of homes in Boston. The data set is obtained from sklearn's dataset. 

In addition to building Linear Regression models, we investigate outliers/ high leverage points, calculate/extract relevant statistics (e.g. F-Statistic), and compare/contrast sklearn vs. stats model libraries.
